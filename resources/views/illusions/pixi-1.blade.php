    <div class="about">
        <p><strong>What: </strong>This is one of famous puzzle makers Sam Loyd's vanishing puzzles, Sam Loyd himself is one of the most historied and famous puzzle makers and has published hundreds of thousands of puzzles. This one, the Disappearing Bicyclist is one of my favorites, using a simple rotation to hide the secrets of the puzzle, yet show you in full plain sight how it is operating.</p>
        <p><strong>How To: </strong>This one is relatively simple to operate, count the bicyclists on the screen, and then click anywhere and count again, you'll see that they go from 13 to 12, and hence the conundrum will arriveâ€¦ where did the extra come from (or go!?)</p>
